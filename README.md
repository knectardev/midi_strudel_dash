2. Flexible grid for regular rectangular looper
with 3/8 time and 4/4 time options. 

3. Flexible circle looper with variable angle / time signature equivalents. 
Update the component shape (does not need to remain triangle) to support placing different sounds types in different rings. 

4. Perhaps, draggable "clips" that have been generated on the palette, to be draggable (or "sendable" to Strudel.

## ðŸŽµ MIDI Note Detection Logic

### Note Capture Process
1. **Device Filtering**: `midiHandler.js` captures raw MIDI input and filters by selected device
2. **Note Processing**: `strudelCoder.js` processes notes with timing information
3. **Chord Detection**: Notes within 20ms window are automatically grouped as chords
4. **Beat Analysis**: Note timestamps are analyzed for tempo patterns
5. **Code Generation**: Notes are converted to Strudel syntax with quantization

### Beat Detection Algorithm
```javascript
// Simplified algorithm flow:
1. Store note timestamps in rolling 8-second window
2. Calculate intervals between consecutive notes  
3. Filter intervals (100ms - 4000ms range)
4. Group similar intervals with 50ms tolerance
5. Find most common interval pattern
6. Convert to BPM: 60000ms / interval
7. Update BPM if difference > 5 BPM and pattern confidence is high
```

### Advanced Features
